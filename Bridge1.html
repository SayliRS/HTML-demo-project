			<p> This is designed as a beam bridge. Beam bridges are the simplest form when it comes to designing these type of structures. </p>
			<p>Also known as Dhola-Sadiya bridge, the recently opened bridge is the longest bridge in India. This connects the states of Assam and Arunachal Pradesh. With much fanfare, PM Narendra Modi inaugurated this stating that a dream is fulfilled. The idea of this was first conceived by the then Chief Minister Mukut Mithi of Arunachal Pradesh in 2003. It took 14 long years to complete and the work was fast-tracked only in 2011.</p>
